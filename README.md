# Twitch.tv-APIstream

Difficulty - Intermediate front end development project

Objective - Build a list to see if a Twitch user is currently streaming using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

Requirements:  
-show whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv  
-click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel  
-if a Twitch user is currently streaming, show additional details about what they are streaming  
-show a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers

HINTS:  
-see an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at: http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541  
-the relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel  
-here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
